# Reddit Sentiment Analysis
## CodeDay Pittsburgh May 2019 - 1st place
The chrome extension and web app allow the user to quickly gain insights on the overall sentiment of subreddit posts through colors. By using IBM's Tone Analyzer API, the provided text is processed for emotion and intensity thereof. Reddit's API was used to extract posts for sentiment analysis. We utilized React, Express.js, and Node.js to implement our core functionality.

To run the web app, make sure you have node.js installed (https://nodejs.org/en/).

After cloning the respository, run:
```
cd web-app
```
```
npm i
```
```
yarn start
```
Then, open up ```localhost:3000``` or the specified port in your browser.

Enjoy!
