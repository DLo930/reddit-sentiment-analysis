\part[0\half]\TAGS{pq}
In a min-heap with $n>0$ nodes, how many are leaves?  Write one
mathematical formula (\textbf{not} a C0 expression) that expresses the
number of leaves regardless of whether $n$ is even or odd.  You may
use $\left\lfloor x\right\rfloor$ to round $x$ down and $\left\lceil
x\right\rceil$ to round $x$ up.

\answer{\linewidth}{$\lceil n/2 \rceil$ or $\lfloor (n+1)/2 \rfloor$
or $\lfloor n/2 \rfloor + (n \mod 2)$}

+0.5pt Correct answer (One possibility: ceil(n/2))

Commentary:
Many variations:
  ceil(n/2)
  floor((n+1)/2)
  floor(n / 2) + (n mod 2)  (using % for mod is ok)
