\Question{Big-O Notation}
%% Task 3: comment version A or B in alternate semesters

Recall the definition for big-O:
\begin{quote}\em
  $g \in O(f)$ if there is a real constant $c > 0$ and some natural
  number $n_0$ such that
  for every $n \ge n_0$ we have $g(n) \le c \cdot f(n)$.
\end{quote}

\begin{parts}
\newcommand{\poly}
  {3n^2 + 7n + 4} % [c=4,n0=8; c=5,n0=4; ...] F19 S18 F16 S16
%  {2n^2 + 5n + 1}  % [c=3,n0=6; c=4,n0=3; ...] F18 S17
%  {4n^2 + 2n + 3}  % [c=5,n0=0; c=6,n0=1; ...] S19 F17

\part[2]\TAGS{big-o}
Demonstrate graphically that $\poly \in O(n^2)$ by finding values for
$c$ and $n_0$ that satisfy the definition above, where $g(n) = \poly$
and $f(n) = n^2$. Draw a picture to illustrate that $cn^2$ acts as an
upper bound to $\poly$ for all $n \ge n_0$ using your values for $c$
and $n_0$. Be sure to label the horizontal and vertical axes.

If you choose to insert a plot (or a picture) generated using an
external application, please \textbf{paste it in the space provided} ---
do not insert it as a new page.

\RUBRIC
Part (a)
TAGS: big-o

Gradescope rubric:
+1pt Reasonable n0 and c (Examples: c=10 and n0=1, ...)
+1pt Clean plot with labeled axes
-0.5pt Curves not labeled

Commentary:
. Answers:
  To check answers: https://www.mathsisfun.com/quadratic-equation-solver.html

  To come up with answers:
  - set c = 1 + quadratic coefficient (or any strictly positive real intead of 1)
  - simplify the inequality cn^2 - (given poly) >= 0
  - plug the coefficients in above web site
  - pick any n0 on the right where the parabola is positive

  Grading: 1 pt for constants, 1 pt for a reasonable picture to
  accompany the constants.  NOTE: If necessary, you can go to
  fooplot.com and plot the two functions if you need to verify.

In one sentence, explain why $\poly \notin O(n)$.
\begin{framed}
\ifprintanswers{\color{\answerColor}
  Since a quadratic function increases more rapidly than a linear
  function, there is no constant that can guarantee that the linear
  function will always be an upper bound to the quadratic function.

\RUBRIC
Part (b)
TAGS: big-o

Gradescope rubric:
+ 0.25 pt  Sentence says that the first function grows faster than the second
+ 0.25 pt  Sentence says that there is no constant that can guarantee that the linear function will always be an upper bound to the quadratic function

Commentary:
. Since a quadratic function increases more rapidly than
  a linear function, there is no constant that can guarantee that the
  linear function will always be an upper bound to the quadratic
  function.

   Grading: 1 pt for anything that indicates that the linear function
   can't be an upper bound to a quadratic since it doesn't grow as
   fast. 1/2 pt for something in the ball park but says something
   vague or inconsistent (try to avoid this, and discuss to maintain
   consistency among graders). 0 pts for something just plain
   wrong. Students might try to justify using the formal definition,
   which is ok if they state something that there's no c that can be
   found that will make the linear function an upper bound...

big-O notation as a function of its arguments in its simplest, tightest
form.

\textbf{Reminder:} as discussed in recitation, in this class when we
are dealing with logarithms, we consider the ``simplest form'' to be
the one \emph{without the base}.  Therefore, we prefer $O(\log n)$
over big-$O$ descriptions like $O(\log_4 n)$ or $O(\ln n)$.
