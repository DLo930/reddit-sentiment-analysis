\Question{Termination}\TAGS{correctness}

Recall that the standard way to prove termination of loops is by
determining an expression that always moves towards a specific bound
on every iteration of the loop. Reaching the bound implies that the
loop terminates.  For each of these functions, either prove that the
loop terminates by providing a C0 expression that must reach a
specific bound to guarantee termination, or show that the loop may not
terminate by providing arguments (specific values for \lstinline'x' and/or
\lstinline'y') on which the loop does not terminate.

Two examples are given below.

\textbf{Example 1}

\begin{lstlisting}
int move(int x, int y)
{
  while (x % 2 == 0)
  {
    x = x + 2;
  }
  return x+y;
}
\end{lstlisting}
This loop does not terminate when \lstinline'x' equals 0 (or any even
number) since an even number plus 2 is always an even number in C0.

\bigskip
\textbf{Example 2}

\begin{lstlisting}
int move(int x, int y)
{
  while (x > 10)
  {
    x--;
    y++;
  }
  return x;
}
\end{lstlisting}
If $x \leq 10$, the loop terminates immediately without running its body.

If $x > 10$, or equivalently if $x-10 > 0$, the quantity $x - 10$
strictly decreases by 1 for each iteration of the loop which means it
must reach the bound of 0 eventually, causing the loop to terminate.
