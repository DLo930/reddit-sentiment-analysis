Set \lstinline'x' equal to \lstinline'p' with its lowest 8 bits
cleared to 0 and with its middle 8 bits set to 1 (so that, for
example, \lstinline'0xAB12CD34' becomes \lstinline'0xAB1FFD00').
\begin{framed}
\begin{lstlisting}[aboveskip=-5pt, belowskip=-5pt]

int x = [*\uanswer{30em}{(p \& 0xFFFFFF00) | 0xFF000}*];
\end{lstlisting}
\end{framed}

\subpart %
Set \lstinline'y' equal to \lstinline'p' with its highest and lowest
16 bits swapped (so that, for example, \lstinline'0x1234ABCD' becomes
\lstinline'0xABCD1234')
\begin{framed}
\begin{lstlisting}[aboveskip=-5pt, belowskip=-5pt]

int y = [*\uanswer{30em}{(p <{}< 16) | ((p >{}> 16) \& 0xFFFF)}*];
\end{lstlisting}
\end{framed}

\subpart %
Set \lstinline'z' equal to \lstinline'p' with its middle 16 bits
flipped ($0 \Longrightarrow 1$ and $1 \Longrightarrow 0$) (so that,
for example \lstinline'0xAB0F1812' becomes \lstinline'0xABF0E712').
\begin{framed}
\begin{lstlisting}[aboveskip=-5pt, belowskip=-5pt]

int z = [*\uanswer{30em}{p \^{}  0x00FFFF00}*];

\RUBRIC
Part (a)

Gradescope rubric:
+ 0.5 pts Box 4 correct [Ex: (p & 0xFFFFFF00) | 0xFF000]
+ 0.5 pts Box 5 correct [Ex: (p << 16) | ((p >> 16) & 0xFFFF)]
+ 0.5 pts Box 6 is correct [Ex: p ^ 0x00FFFF00]

Commentary:
1/2 point for each box. Read instructions below... if something significant wrong, it's wrong.

Lots of correct answers, so grading this requires a little thought and/or
use of coin.

No partial credit. If they use 1s in place of Fs (either binary:
0b00000000111111111111111100000000 or pseudo-hex-binary 0x00111100
where they meant 0x00FFFF00) then one point penalty (that is, max
score of .5, don't give negative points).

Don't be picky about most syntax errors (stuff like && instead of & is
bad but, for now, it gets caught by the compiler). Be picky about
actually-incorrect omission of parens and use of illegal operators,
though. Shift binds MORE tightly than bitwise ops, bitwise ops all
associate to the left, & binds more tightly than ^, which binds more
tightly than |.

No addition! ONLY &, |, ^, ~, <<, >>, per the problem spec.

i)   x = (p & 0xFFFFFF00) | 0x000FF000;
     x = (p & 0xFFF00F00) | 0x000FF000;
     x = (p | 0x000FF000) & 0xFFFFFF00;

ii)  y = ((p >> 16) & 0xFFFF) | (p << 16)

iii) z = p ^ 0x00FFFF00
     z = (p & 0xFF0000FF) | (~p & 0x00FFFF00)
