Gradescope rubric:
+0.2pt False (Short-circuiting evaluation)

Commentary:
The answer is no, because of short-circuiting evaluation the first
expression may divide by zero and the second will not.
 * 0.2pt for a correct answer and a specific counterexample
 * 0.2pt for a correct answer and a reasonable explanation (if the
   phrases 'short circuit', 'division-by-0', or 'order of evaluation'
   appear they should be set)
 * 0.1pt for "No" and an answer that is misguided or missing
 * 0pt for an incorrect answer
