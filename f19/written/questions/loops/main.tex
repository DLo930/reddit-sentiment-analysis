\Question{Thinking about Loops}

%% Change questions at the bottom of this file

When we think about loops in 15-122, we will always concentrate on a
single iteration of the loop. A loop will almost always modify something;
the following loop modifies the local assignable \lstinline'i'.

\begin{lstlisting}
while (i < n) {
   i = i + 4;
}
\end{lstlisting}

In order to reason about the loop, we have to think about the two
different values stored in the local assignable \lstinline'i' during
an iteration.

We use the variable $i$ to talk about the value stored in the local
\lstinline'i' before the loop runs (before the loop guard is checked
for the first time).

We use the ``primed'' variable $i'$ to talk about the value stored in
the local \lstinline'i' after the loop runs exactly one more time
(before the loop guard is next checked).
