\RUBRIC
alloc-size

Gradescope rubric:
+0.5pt Explains how the allocation should be 100*sizeof(int) - as the array access would be unsafe otherwise

Commentary:
  Allocation should be 100*sizeof(int); assuming ints are more than 1
  memory  unit there is not enough space in the array and there is an
  out-of-bounds error.
