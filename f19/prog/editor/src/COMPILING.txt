Homework 4: Implementing a Text Editor
--------------------------------------

Test your code early and often!  You can use either the coin interpreter or
you can create one or more main functions IN SEPARATE FILES.  Please do NOT
put a main function in either the gap-buffer.c0 or text-buffer.c0 files you
submit. You may find the functions in visuals.c0 useful for testing and
debugging.

When we compile your code, we will use the following command line:

    cc0 -d -x text-editor-test.c0 > expected.out

Your code must compile using these instructions with files shown in the order
given.  Please do NOT change any of the struct and typedef declarations in
gap-buffer.c0 or text-buffer.c0.

WARNING: If your code does not compile, you will lose at least half credit on
each task that is affected.  Be sure you compile your code before you hand in.
Do not add annotations at the last minute... but if you do, make sure you
compile again to check your work.
