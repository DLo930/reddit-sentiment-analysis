Willam's comments: make some theory that meshes with the coding for
this assignment! People are not reasoning about their code.  Doing
this properly might involve an is_dll_segment that would actually
allow loop invariants to be placed in many of the loops where, here,
they are sadly lacking.

[The doubly-linked-list question on Homework 7 in f14 does something
for this with the question about a broken is_segment function, but I
think this should be left in as a semi-permanent OOPS to keep things
like this in mind. - RJS Spring 2015]
