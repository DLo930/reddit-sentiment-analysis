==========================================================

Using the imagediff utility: you have been given the result of running
remove_green on both a correct and a buggy implementation of
g5.png. Running the following command shows that the two images differ
by 600 pixels.

   % imagediff -i images/g5-remove-green.png -j images/g5-remove-green-bug.png
   Loaded image images/g5-remove-green.png. Dimensions are 800 by 600.
   Loaded image images/g5-remove-green-bug.png. Dimensions are 800 by 600.
   Number of pixels with different colors: 600 out of 480000.
   0

If you want to visually see where these 600 different pixels actually
are, you can get imagediff to print out a new image that highlights
the places where differences occured:

   % imagediff -i images/g5-remove-green.png -j images/g5-remove-green-bug.png -o diff.png
   % display diff.png &

In addition to writing test cases, this can be a useful way of
debugging your code.

==========================================================

Compiling remove-green and test cases:
   % cc0 -d -w -o remove-green-test pixel.c0 imageutil.c0 remove-green.c0 remove-green-test.c0
   % ./remove-green-test

   % cc0 -d -w -o remove-green pixel.c0 imageutil.c0 remove-green.c0 remove-green-main.c0
   % ./remove-green -i images/g5.png -o images/g5-my-output.png
       (This creates the output file images/g5-my-output.png. If you
        left off the "-o images/g5-my-output.png" part, the output
        file would be called images/g5_remove-green.png.)
