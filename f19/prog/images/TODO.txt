A good "second assignment" (rotate, reflect) would be moving the origin. You could have two versions, one that imagines an infinite tiling of the plane

A B C
D E F
G H I
J K L

--> move 1,1

L K J
C A B
F D E
I G H

--> move -2, 0

B C A
E F D
H I G
K L J

and one that imagines the rest of the plane is full of transparent white pixels.

--> move 1,1

B C X
E F X
H I X
X X X

--> move -2, 0

X X A
X X D
X X G
X X J
