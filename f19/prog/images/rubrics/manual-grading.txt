15-122 Images manual contracts, style grading and bonus manipulations instructions and rubric

We are grading contracts and style for images.  We are also judging their bonus manipulations.

################################################################################

*How To Grade Style and Contracts*

1) Go the 15-122 shared documents (on Google Docs) and click on the entry entitled "Manual Grading". There, go to the 'Images' tab. This will tell you which submissions you are responsible for.
   Go to the 'Images' tab.  This will tell you which submissions you are responsible for.
2) Go to autolab.andrew.cmu.edu
3) Navigate to the Images Assignment
4) Click "Grade all submissions" under CA Options
5) It should be sorted already, but you can also click on "Email & Name" at the top to make it
   properly sorted a-z by Andrew ID
6) Click on the arrow next to a student's email, this will open a new tab
   a) on that tab, click on the magnifying glass next to files ('rotate.c0' or 'reflect.c0') and
      ('mask.c0' or blur.c0') -- depending on the semester -- see below.
   b) If you are deducting points, make sure to leave a comment in their code. This can be done by
      mousing over the line numbers and clicking the green "+". For contracts, use the form below.
      For style points, make sure the comment starts with "FIXSTYLE:"
   c) enter an overall assessment (see below) on line 1
   d) If you deducted points, MAKE SURE YOU LEFT A COMMENT in their code.  If did not deduct points,
   change the "-" to "0".
   e) Go back to the Autolab page with all the submissions, and update the postconditions grade by
      clicking the "-" in the row of the person you were just grading (Do not release the grade when
      completed)
7) When you finish all your students, update the spreadsheet to reflect that

CONTRACTS (0 to 3 points)

As you grade contracts, cut and paste the following rubric into the Autolab feedback box and
fill in the <<Write me!>>.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rubric items earned: ____<<Write me!>>___
Rubric items not earned: ____<<Write me!>>___

A (1pt) ensures \length(\result) == \length(pixels) in blur/apply_mask postcondition
B (1pt) ensures 4*\length(pixels) or 4*width*height or (width*2)*(height*2) in reflect/rotate postcondition
C1 (1pt) all loop invariants (checks of variable boundaries) are present in blur/apply_mask and reflect/rotate
C2 (0.5pt) only some loop invariants are present in blur/apply_mask and reflect/rotate
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note that C1 and C2 are exclusive: do not give anybody both C1 and C2.

STYLE (negative grading, all-or-nothing: -15 or 0 points)

Be kind, be constructive, be complimentary: the point is to give general, constructive feedback but
also give people things to fix where necessary ("FIXSTYLE" issues).

If taking off points for style, be sure to leave a comment on the line with the prefix "FIXSTYLE"
so students know to fix those issues in order to receive points back.

We'll let students know when grades are released that in order to get these points back, they'll
need to fix their style and show a TA their updated code.
Style-grade the file that received more regular points: If someone got only 1-2 points on rotate,
grade mask.  If someone got 1-2 points on both rotate and mask, grade imageutil.

As you grade style, if a student's submission receives a negative score, copy and paste the
following message into the Autolab feedback box, including the lines marked (A) (B) or (C) as
necessary:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You have 5 days to address the style issues in your code (if any) and show your fixes to a TA.  Look for TA comments starting with FIXSTYLE.

  (A) Multiple cases of bad indentation
  (B) Dead code
  (C) Lines longer than 80 characters
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following are good reasons to give a score of -15 points for style:
  a) Multiple cases of bad indentation (If it's just 1-2 isolated cases, just make a note of it)
  b) Dead code (unless it's a single debug print statement or something similar -- make a note)
  c) Lines are too long (lines longer than 80 characters) (don't take off points for isolated cases, but make a note)

*Issues for which to make a FIXSTYLE note but NOT take off points*
  a) Poor variable names
  b) Obviously inefficient code - like not caching frequently used partial calculations.
  c) Not splitting long requires/ensures conditions over multiple requires/ensures (if possible to do so)

How to judge the bonus manipulation task:

a) On Autolab, click on 'View Scoreboard' and note any submission whose manipulation (picture in the
   'Custom Manipulation' column) you find cool/intriguing/interesting -- we're looking at the
   manipulation not the subject of the picture.
b) In the above spreadsheet, go to the 'Images > bonus' tab
c) Pick any TAxx column marked 'free' and put an 'x' in correspondence of every submission you
   selected in (a)
