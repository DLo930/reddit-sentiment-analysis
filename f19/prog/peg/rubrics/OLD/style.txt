The "style" grade for this assignment is mostly about checking for autograder
fitting.

Style points start and 0 and go negative after deductions.

The easiest way to get started is to just read the last file the student
got points on (peg3 in most cases).

* -1 point: leaving in lots of commented-out code, dozens and dozens
            of commented-out printfs
* -1 point: basic formatting issues
* -1 point: bad comments/no comments
* -1 to -2 points: bad contracts/no contracts
* -1 to -5 points: apparent autograder fitting

We're aiming to deduct no more than 5 points.
