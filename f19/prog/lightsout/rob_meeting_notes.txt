Bit Arrays:
agnostic to length
type is unsigned int

Lights out:
Resistant to bitarray changes



Have Hash Tables:
ba_ht_insert(ht H, bitarray* B)
ba_ht_member(ht H, bitarray* B)
ht ba_ht_new()
void ba_ht_free(ht H)

Give them main while loop of lights out

Have better error msg for generic hash table impl

bitarray + move that got them there
struct data {
	uint8_t last_move;
	bitarray board;
};

in this order!!

Solution, Autograder, Writeup
