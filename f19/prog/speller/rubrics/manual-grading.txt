INSTRUCTIONS:
- Each point is all or nothing -- **they have to get it right in both Shakespeare and Twitter**, or else they probably just hardcoded an answer and so they don't get that point.
- The only adjustment (partial credit) is if they made some interpretation error like only doing the three most common words or giving the most common words but omitting their frequencies.
- Formatting does not matter unless it makes the answer ambiguous.
