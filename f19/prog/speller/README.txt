NOTE: The autograder for 2 points of task 5 is FRAGILE.  It attempts
to distinguish an O(n) and an O(n log n) algorithms by measuring their
execution time.  This does not alway work even for correct
implementations.  False negatives can be identified via visual
inspection or by running the autograder several times.


This homework contains tasks that are autograded only after the
submission deadline.

To install the student-facing version of the autograder (which does
not grade all tasks):
- in src/grader.py, set the variable FINAL to False
- install the homework on Autolab

To install the post-deadline version of the autograder (which grades
all tasks):
- in src/grader.py, set the variable FINAL to True
- install the homework on Autolab
- on Autolab, navigate to 'Admin Options > Manage Submissions' and click
  'Regrade All' (please avoid times near the submission deadline of
  other courses)
