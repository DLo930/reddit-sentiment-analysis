RUBRIC:
As you grade analysis, cut and paste the following rubric into the Autolab feedback box and fill in the <<Write me!>>.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rubric items earned: ____<<Write me!>>____
Rubric items not earned: ____<<Write me!>>____
Adjustments: ____<<Write me!>>____

A (1.5pt) four most common words with frequencies
B (1.5pt) words that appear exactly 128 times
C (1.5pt) number of singletons in the corpus
D (1.5pt) number of distinct frequencies in the corpus
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

INSTRUCTIONS:
- Each point is all or nothing -- **they have to get it right in both Shakespeare and Twitter**, or else they probably just hardcoded an answer and so they don't get that point.
- The only adjustment (partial credit) is if they made some interpretation error like only doing the three most common words or giving the most common words but omitting their frequencies.
- Formatting does not matter unless it makes the answer ambiguous.
