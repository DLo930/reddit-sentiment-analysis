TITLE: Laptop Setup for Linux

CONTENT (paste into plain-text editor on Piazza):
=================================================

If you have a Linux computer, follow these steps to set it up to connect to the Andrew system. If you need help, come to one of the setup sessions this week.
For Mac, see @[TBD].
For Windows, see @[TBD].

1) Open a Terminal window and use the following command to connect via SSH:
<pre>ssh -X YOURANDREWID@unix.andrew.cmu.edu</pre>

2) Check to make sure that X forwarding is working properly by running this command:
<pre>display ~rjsimmon/public/couch.jpg &amp;</pre>
After a few seconds (be patient!), you should see a window appear with a picture of a couch. If that works, you're all set up! Just use the command from step 1 whenever you want to connect.

If you're getting errors or having trouble, ask a TA at a setup session.
