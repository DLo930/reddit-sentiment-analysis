\textbf{Setup:} Copy the lab code from our public directory to your
private directory:

\begin{lstlisting}[language={[coin]C}]
% cd private/15122
% cp -R /afs/andrew/course/15/122/misc/lab04 .
% cd lab04
\end{lstlisting}
% formerly, lab-testing


\textbf{Grading:} For full credit, your tests should catch at least
half of the bugs.  For extra credit, write tests that catch all of the
bugs!

\fbox{\parbox{\linewidth}{%
\textbf{Reminder}: it's okay if you don't get extra credit on every
lab! The way we grade labs, you will get all the possible points as
long as you attend every lab and get full credit on a handful of
labs.}}
