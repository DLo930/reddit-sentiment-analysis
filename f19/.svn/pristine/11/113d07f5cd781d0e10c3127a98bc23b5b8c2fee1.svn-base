/* The file pixel.c0 describes the pixel type. It also defines the
 * pixel interface with five functions: get_red(p), get_green(p),
 * get_blue(p), get_alpha(p), and make_pixel(a,r,g,b).
 *
 * We're going to check that you represent pixels as integers where
 * the bits describe the alpha value, red intensity, green intensity,
 * and blue intensity (in that order). However, if you're *given* a
 * working pixel implementation, you can use the pixel interface
 * without knowing which part of the integer is used to store the blue
 * intensity. You don't even need to know that pixels are integers!
 *
 * When writing this file, only use the interface of pixels.c0. We'll
 * check your code by compiling and running it against different
 * implementations of the pixel interface.
 *
 * There are 4 tasks in this file:
 *  - 4 - Modifying pixels while respecting interfaces
 *  - 5 - Implement quantize() as described in the writeup
 *  - 6 - Testing quantize()
 *  - 7 - Returning multiple values */

/* Task 7
 *
 * In C and C0, it's a bit difficult to return more than one value
 * from a function. For instance, say we needed to know, given an
 * array of pixels, how many pixels had red intensity 0, how many
 * pixels had blue intensity 0, and how many pixels had green
 * intensity 0.
 *
 * We could write three different functions to return these three
 * values, but what we'd like to do instead is write one loop that
 * calculates all three values. Then, those three values are returned
 * to the user by modifying the contents of an array that was passed
 * to the function.
 *
 * The function count_zeroes is supposed to count the number of
 * 0-intensity red, green, and blue pixels and store the results in
 * results[0], results[1], and results[2], respectively. In other
 * words, the pixel array A[] is an input and should not change, but
 * the integer array results[] is an output, and we have to change
 * it.
 *
 * This function has a couple of bugs and therefore fails
 * the test cases below. Fix it, but do not change the interface. (You
 * shouldn't need to change the test cases, either.) */
