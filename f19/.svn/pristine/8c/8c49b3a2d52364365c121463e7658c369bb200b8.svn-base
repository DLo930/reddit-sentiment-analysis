\Question{The Preservation of Loop Invariants}\TAGS{loop-invariant}

The core of proving the correctness of a function with one loop is
proving that the loop invariant is \emph{preserved} --- that if the loop
invariant holds at the beginning of an iteration (just before
the loop guard is tested), it still holds at the end of that iteration
(just before the loop guard is tested the next time).

For each of the following loops, state whether the loop invariant is
ALWAYS PRESERVED or NOT ALWAYS PRESERVED. If you say that the loop
invariant is always preserved, prove it using point-to reasoning.  If
you say that the loop invariant is not always preserved, give a
\emph{specific counterexample}. When we ask for a counterexample, what
we mean is that we want \emph{specific, concrete} values of the local
variables such that the loop guard and loop invariant will hold before
the loop body executes for some iteration, but where the loop
invariant will not hold after the loop body executes that one
iteration.

Here are two solved examples to give you an idea of how to write your
solutions. Integers are defined as C0's 32-bit signed two's-complement
numbers; be careful about this when you think about counterexamples!

\RUBRIC
In general, it's okay if they're clear that it's always preserved
(giving a proof) or not always preserved (giving a counterexample)
even if they don't write that explicitly.
