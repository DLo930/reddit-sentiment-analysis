\RUBRIC
semicolon

Gradescope rubric:
+0.5pt Point out that there is an extra semicolon at the end of line 6 - all or nothing

Commentary:
  This prints out 1001, because of the semicolon
  (only necessary to say the semicolon caused something bad to happen)
  (half a point penalty if they say 1000 but have the right idea)
  (no points for claiming it's unsafe/undefined - it's safe)
