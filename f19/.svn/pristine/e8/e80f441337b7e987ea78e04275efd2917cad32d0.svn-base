\section*{A generic dictionary implementation}

\begin{part}\TAGS{bst, dictionary, genericity, function-pointer}
  Update \lstinline'gen-dict.c1' to implement a generic dictionary,
  adding in the necessary fields to the struct and altering each of
  the functions as needed.

  Testing: \lstinline[language={[coin]C}]'% make test-gen-dict'

  \begin{solution}\-\ \\
  Line 42: \texttt{key k;}\\
  Line 43: \texttt{value v;}\\
  Line 62: \texttt{key mid = T->k;}\\
  Line 103: \texttt{T->k = k;}\\
  Line 104: \texttt{T->v = v;}\\
  Line 109: \texttt{int r = (*compare)(k, T->k);}\\
  Line 111: \texttt{T->v = v;}\\
  Line 135: \texttt{int r = (*compare)(k, T->k);}\\
  Line 137: \texttt{return T->v;}
