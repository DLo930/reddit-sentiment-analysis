\part[1]\TAGS{pq, queue, stack}
Suppose a sequence of $n$ elements are inserted into a priority queue
so that the priority of each element inserted is strictly
decreasing. Afterward, the elements are removed one at a time based
on priority. What common data structure does this priority queue
implement?
