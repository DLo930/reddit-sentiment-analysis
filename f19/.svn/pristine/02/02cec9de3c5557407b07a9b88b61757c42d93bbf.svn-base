\RUBRIC

Learning Objectives (AKA Evaluation Summary)
* proving assertions
* 32-bit integers using 2's complement
* correctness of functions with one loop
* preservation of loop invariants

Gradescope rubric (no points, first two are always the same):
-0pt EXCELLENT JOB!!!
-0pt There are several concepts you have doubts about (see below): please consider going to office hours.

-0pt You appear to be having difficulty proving assertions.
-0pt You don't seem to have a good understanding of how 32-bit integers using 2's complement work.
-0pt You seem to be a bit confused about proving the correctness of a function with one loop.
âˆ’0pt It looks like you don't have a good grasp on how to prove the preservation of loop invariants.
