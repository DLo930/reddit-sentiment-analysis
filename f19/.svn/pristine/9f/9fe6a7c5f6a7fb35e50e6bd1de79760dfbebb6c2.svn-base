\RUBRIC

Learning Objectives (AKA Evaluation Summary)
* Complexity of a given function
* Big-O definition
* Function correctness

Gradescope rubric (no points, first two are always the same):
-0pt EXCELLENT JOB!!!
-0pt There are several concepts you have doubts about (see below): please consider going to office hours.

-0pt You appear to be having difficulty with determining the Complexity of a given function
-0pt You do not seem to fully understand the definition of big-O and how to use it
-0pt You still don't seem comfortable with proving the correctness of a function
