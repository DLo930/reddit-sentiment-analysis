\newcommand{\shortdesc}{This written homework covers big-$O$ notation,
  some reasoning about searching and sorting algorithms, pointers,
  interfaces, and stacks and queues.  You will use some of the
  functions from the arrayutil.c0 library, as well as the data
  structure interfaces introduced in lecture this week.

  This is the first homework to emphasize interfaces. It's important
  for you to think carefully and be sure that your solutions respect
  the interface involved in the problem.}
