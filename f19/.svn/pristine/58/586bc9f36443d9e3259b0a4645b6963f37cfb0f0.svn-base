\paragraph{Preparing your Submission}
You can prepare your submission with any PDF editor that you like.
Here are a few that prior-semester students recommended:
\begin{itemize}
\itemsep=-0.5ex
\vspace{-1.5ex}
\item%
  \href{http://www.pdfescape.com}{\textbf{\em pdfescape}}
  or \href{https://dochub.com/}{\textbf{\em dochub}}, two
  web-based PDF editors that work from anywhere.
\item%
  \href{https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201740}{\textbf{\em
      Preview}}, the Mac's PDF viewer.
\item%
  \textbf{\em Acrobat Pro}, installed on all
  \href{https://www.cmu.edu/computing/software/all/}{non-CS cluster
    machines}, works on many platforms.
\item%
  \href{https://www.iannotate.com/}{\textbf{\em iAnnotate}} works on
  any iOS and Android mobile device.
\end{itemize}
\vspace{-1.5ex}
There are many more --- use whatever works best for you.  If you'd
rather not edit a PDF, you can always print this homework, write your
answers \emph{neatly} by hand, and scan it into a PDF file ---
\emph{we don't recommend this option, though}.

% You can prepare your submission in one of two ways:
% \begin{description}
% \itemsep=0pt
% \item[Just edit (preferred)~]%
%   Use any PDF editor (e.g., Preview on Mac, iAnnotate on mobile, Acrobat
%   Pro \href{https://www.cmu.edu/computing/software/all/}{installed
%     on all non-CS cluster machines} and most platforms)
%  to typeset your answers in the given
%   spaces --- you can even draw pictures.  \emph{That's it.}

% \item[Print and Scan~]%
%   Alternatively, print this file, write your answers \emph{neatly} by
%   hand, and then scan it into a PDF file.  \emph{This is pretty
%   labor-intensive.}
% \end{description}

\paragraph{Submitting your Work}
Once you are done, submit this assignment on
\href{\gradescope}{Gradescope}.  \textbf{\em Always check it was correctly
  uploaded.}  \underline{You have unlimited submissions.}
