Notes for testing of student code.

For the correctness tests we should add tests for the following:

1. An annotation //@assert \length(resultpixels) >= width*height; // (times a factor for reflect and rotate)

2. We should test that the original image stays the same.

3. image_destroy is deprecated. Images are now garbage collected.
