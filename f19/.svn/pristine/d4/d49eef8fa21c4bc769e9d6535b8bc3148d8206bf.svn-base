To add a bit of entropy, the string the students need to hand for
should be modified semester after semester.  To do so:
- Change the greeting at the bottom of Piazza post "How to use Piazza (effectively)"
- Change the greeting in solution/scavhunt.c0
- Change the greeting in cell A[4] in src/scavhunt-test.c0
