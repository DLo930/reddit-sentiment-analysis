Scenario: no idea where to start (Masking portion of images assignment)
  Fundamental issue: Student is unable to break the problem into smaller subproblems
    (for example, starting with a higher-level plan rather than details of obtaining
      specific pixels)
    Example of a tough problem in this assignment: when moving the mask over the
      image and iterating over the mask itself, how can we tell whether the mask hangs
      over the edge of the image?
    Additional difficulties: student is unable to provide a specific area of difficulty
      or can't articulate a specific source of confusion

  TA tips:
    Create a specific example (eg. walk through the example in the handout)
    Break the problem down into smaller subproblems, or approach the problem at a
      higher level in order to prevent getting tangled in little details
    Think about different cases within the problem
    Guide student through pseudocode
