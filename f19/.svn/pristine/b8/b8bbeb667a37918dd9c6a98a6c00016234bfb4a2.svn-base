\RUBRIC
assign

Gradescope rubric:
+0.5pt Point out that '=' was used instead of '==' - all or nothing

Commentary:
This will print "ROB: Hello, FRANK? Do you read me?\n"
because of the assignment. Be lax.
  "Will print the wrong thing" is fine
  "Undefined behavior of writing to read-only memory" is fine
  "Should use ==" is fine
