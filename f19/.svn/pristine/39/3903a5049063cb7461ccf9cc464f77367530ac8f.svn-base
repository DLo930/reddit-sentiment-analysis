Gradescope rubric (no points, first two are always the same):
-0pt EXCELLENT JOB!!!
-0pt There are several concepts you have doubts about (see below): please consider going to office hours.

-0pt You still don't seem comfortable with function contracts
-0pt It looks like you don't have a good grasp of loop invariants
-0pt You look a bit confused about how to find counterexamples
-0pt You appear to be having difficulty with correctness proofs
