\part[0\half]\TAGS{pq}
You are given a non-empty min-heap.  In one sentence, describe
precisely where the maximum value must be located.  Do not assume the
heap is implemented as an array --- your vocabulary should pertain
only to the tree definition of a heap.
\begin{framed}
\bigskip\bigskip
\answer{\linewidth}{The maximum will be at a leaf node.\hfill}
\end{framed}

\RUBRIC
Part <max position>
TAGS: pq

Gradescope rubric:
+0.5pt  A leaf node
-0.25pt  Only saying that it is on the last level

Commentary:
 The maximum should be at a leaf node
     half for saying should be at last level
ENDRUBRIC


\part[0\half]\TAGS{complexity, pq}
What is the worst-case runtime complexity of finding the maximum in a
min-heap if the min-heap has $n$ elements and is implemented as an
array? Why?

\begin{framed}
$O(\uanswer{8em}{$n$})$

\medskip
Because the number of values that need to be examined is \uanswer{8em}{$(n+1)/2$}.
\end{framed}

\RUBRIC
Part <max cost>
TAGS: complexity, pq

Gradescope rubric:
+0.25pts  O(n)
+0.25pts  (n+1)/2 -- n/2 accepted too

Commentary:
O(n), the number of values to be examined is (n+1)/2
    Full points for n/2.
    Half points for O(n), number of values that need to be examined is n.
