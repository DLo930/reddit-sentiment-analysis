\Question[2]{Termination Arguments}\TAGS{correctness}

Termination arguments for loops (in this class, at least) have the
following form:
\begin{quote}\em
  During an arbitrary iteration of the loop, the quantity
  \uanswer{2em}{} gets strictly \smash{\underline{larger/smaller}}, but from
  the loop invariants, we know this quantity can't ever get
  \smash{\underline{bigger/smaller}} than \uanswer{2em}{}.
\end{quote}
Explain why the loops below terminate. A quantity can
be a C0 expression; it doesn't have to be a single local.
