TITLE: Laptop Setup for Mac

CONTENT (paste into plain-text editor on Piazza):
=================================================

If you have a Mac, follow these steps to set up your personal computer to connect to the Andrew system. If you need help, come to one of the setup sessions this week.
For Linux, see @[TBD].
For Windows, see @[TBD].

1) Download and install <a href="https://www.xquartz.org/" target="_blank">XQuartz</a>, then restart your computer.

2) Open a Terminal window and use the following command to connect via SSH:
<pre>ssh -Y YOURANDREWID@unix.andrew.cmu.edu</pre>
If that doesn't work, try replacing the <tt>-Y</tt> with <tt>-X</tt>.

3) Check to make sure that XQuartz is working properly by running this command:
<pre>display ~rjsimmon/public/couch.jpg &amp;</pre>
After a few seconds (be patient!), you should see a window appear with a picture of a couch. If that works, you're all set up! Just use the command from step 2 whenever you want to connect.

If you're getting errors or having trouble, ask a TA at a setup session.
