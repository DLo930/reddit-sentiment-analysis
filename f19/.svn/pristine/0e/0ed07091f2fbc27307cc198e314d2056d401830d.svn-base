--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*How To Grade:*
1) Go the 15-122 shared documents (on Google Docs) and click on the entry entitled "Manual Grading". There, go to the 'Pixels' tab. This will tell you which submissions you are responsible for.
2) Go to autolab.andrew.cmu.edu
3) Navigate to the Pixels Assignment
4) Click "Grade all submissions" under CA Options
5) It should be sorted already, but you can also click on "Email & Name" at the top to make it properly sorted a-z by Andrew ID
6) Click on the arrow next to a student's email, this will open a new tab
  a) on that tab, click on the magnifying glass next to 'pixel.c0'
  b) locate get_green, get_red and get_blue.  For each, if the postcondition is incorrect or missing, click on the green "+" and enter an explanation (see below). You don't have to put anything in the score box next to the comment.
  c) enter an overall assessment (see below) on line 1
  d) If you deducted points, MAKE SURE YOU LEFT A COMMENT in their code.
  e) Go back to the autolab page with all the submissions, and update the postconditions grade by clicking the "-" in the row of the person you were just grading (Do not release the grade when completed)
7) When you finish all your students, update the spreadsheet to reflect that


*Pixels Postconditions Rubric:*
- get_red/green/blue rubric: IF INCORRECT OR MISSING, enter one of the following (see below for examples)
  . Missing postcondition
  . Incorrect: postcondition too strong
  . Incorrect: postcondition too weak
  . Incorrect: postcondition always true
  (if student has other postcondition error, write appropriate comment)
- Overall evaluation: IF NOT GETTING FULL POINTS, enter one of the following
  . 0.5 points: one incorrect or missing postcondition, or an off-by-one error on all postconditions
  . 0 points: more than one incorrect or missing postcondition
  (If you prefer to write something always, enter
  . 1 point: all postconditions correct.  Keep up the good work!
  )


Further information for graders:

Correct postconditions are of the form 0 <= \result && \result <= 255, or any other boolean to the same effect (0 <= \result && \result < 256, etc).

Examples of correct responses:
//@ensures 0 <= \result && \result <= 255;
//@ensures 0 <= \result && \result < 256;

Examples of incorrect responses:
<no postcondition>
//@ensures 0 < \result && \result <= 255; // Too strong
//@ensures 0 <= \result && \result <= 256; // Too weak
//@ensures 0 <= \result || \result <= 255; // Always true

Scoring:
1 point for all postconditions correct
0.5 points for all but one postcondition correct, or an off by one error on all postconditions (e.g. a systematic error like the "too strong" and "too weak" examples)
0 points otherwise
