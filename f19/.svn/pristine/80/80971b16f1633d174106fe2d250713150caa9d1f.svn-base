\Question[2]{Pointer Illustration}\TAGS{aliasing, memory-model, pointer}

Clearly and carefully illustrate the contents of memory after the
following code runs. We've drawn the contents of \lstinline'w', a pointer
that points into allocated memory where the number 0 is stored.

\smallskip
\begin{lstlisting}
int* w = alloc(int);
int i = 42;
int* p = alloc(int);
int* q = p;
int* r = alloc(int);
int** x = alloc(int*);
int** y = x;
int** z = alloc(int*);
*r = i + 7;
*x = q;
**y = *r - i;
p = NULL;
*z = r;
i = *q + **x + *w;
\end{lstlisting}

1 point
  . i, *p, and *r return the correct answers, q is NULL
  . All or nothing (this was easy for them to test)
1 point - Structure is correct: p == q, y == z, *x == r, *y == p
  . Half of this point if no more than two structure arrows are wrong
