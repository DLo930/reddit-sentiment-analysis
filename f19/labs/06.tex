During the Clac/Exp programming assignment (not just during this lab),
we furthermore encourage you to share any interesting Clac programs
you write with other students on \qatool{}.

\textbf{Setup:} \emph{There is no handout for this lab.}

\textbf{Grading:} For two points, you must correctly answer (1.a), (2.a), and
(2.b). Write down your answers and get a TA to check them. For three points,
finish the rest of the lab.
