\section*{Storing and using strings in C}

Load the file \lstinline'ex1.c' into a text editor. Read through the file and write down what you think the output will be before you run the program:

\lstinline[language={[coin]C}]'word string: '\shortanswerline{ace\hspace*{9.1em}}

\lstinline[language={[coin]C}]'word ASCII values: '%
\shortanswerline{97\hspace*{0.9em}}~~\shortanswerline{99\hspace*{0.9em}}~~\shortanswerline{101\hspace*{0.4em}}~~\shortanswerline{0\hspace*{1.4em}}

Once you have done this, compile with the following command (all on one line):

\texttt{\% gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -Wshadow -std=c99}\\
\hspace*{0.5in} \texttt{-pedantic -g ex1.c}

\begin{solution}\\
word string: \texttt{ace}\\
word ASCII values: \texttt{97 99 101 0}
\end{solution}

\begin{part}\TAGS{c-numbers, c-memory, string}
  Which parts differed from what you expected?

\end{part}

\begin{part}\TAGS{c-memory, string, testing}
  Change the `\texttt{\textbackslash0}' character in the array to
  something else, like `\texttt{d}'. Predict how this will change the
  answer, and then compile and see if you're right.

\begin{solution}\\
word string: \texttt{aced<??gibberish??>}\\
word ASCII values: \texttt{97 99 101 100}
\end{solution}
\end{part}

\begin{part}\TAGS{c-memory, correctness, string, testing}
  Run the modified code under \lstinline'valgrind', and read through
  its output to see which lines in \lstinline'ex1.c' are given as part
  of the output.

\begin{solution}
\begin{lstlisting}[language={[coin]C}]
Conditional jump or move depends on uninitialised value(s)
      at 0x4E7DA94: vfprintf (in /usr/lib64/libc-2.17.so)
      by 0x4E86C18: printf (in /usr/lib64/libc-2.17.so)
      by 0x40055D: main (ex1.c:10)
\end{lstlisting}
\end{solution}
\end{part}

At this point, compare notes with people around you to see if you have
the same answers for (1.b) and (1.c).  Ask a TA if there's anything
you're unsure about!
