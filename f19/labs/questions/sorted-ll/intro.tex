\section*{Introduction}

Hyrum's cloud-based motorcycle repair company \emph{C0 on Wheels} is
in trouble! In order to prepare for large number of clients and their
motorcycles repairs, he implemented a new data structure to keep track
of id numbers in sorted order. Unfortunately, all of his
implementations seem to be having weird problems! He's hired YOU to
figure out the problems with his code.  The future of this
SaaS (Scooter-repair as a Service) company is in your hands!
