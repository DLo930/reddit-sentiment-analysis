\section*{Setting up your Linux Account}

Now that you know how to navigate in the Linux machine, it needs to be
set up so that you have syntax highlighting and can use the course tools.

\begin{part}\TAGS{unix}
At the prompt, enter the command
\begin{lstlisting}[language={[coin]C},deletekeywords={do}]
% /afs/andrew/course/15/122/bin/15122-setup.sh
- files modified: ~/.bashrc, ~/emacs, ~/.vimrc (older versions are backed up)
- your default shell will now be bash
You do *not* need to run this script again
\end{lstlisting}
If you run into difficulties, ask a TA\@.  You can alternatively look
at the instructions at
\url{http://c0.typesafety.net/tutorial/Setting-up-your-environment.html}
(but you shouldn't need to).
\end{part}
