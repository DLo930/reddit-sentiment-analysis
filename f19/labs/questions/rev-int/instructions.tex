\textbf{Setup:} Copy the lab code from our
public directory to your private directory:

\lstinline[language={[coin]C}]'% cd private/15122'\\
\lstinline[language={[coin]C}]'% cp -R /afs/andrew/course/15/122/misc/lab-integers .'\\
\lstinline[language={[coin]C}]'% cd lab-integers'

You should write your code in a file, \lstinline'reverse.c0', in
the directory \lstinline'lab-integers'.

\textbf{Grading:} You will work through (1.a) and (1.b) as a group.
Finish (2.a) for lab credit, and (2.b) for potentially more
credit. Show your TA that you've passed the tests when you complete
these parts. You can work on these problems with your neighbors and
compare notes and solutions!

\medskip
In this lab, you'll be implementing two distinct ways of
reversing a seven-digit decimal number --- one using mathematical
operations (or bitwise operations, if you'd like!) and one using
arrays. There are multiple ways to do each!
