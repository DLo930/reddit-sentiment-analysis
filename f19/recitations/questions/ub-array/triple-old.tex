\checkpoint*{\TAGS{array, amortized-cost}}

Repeat this analysis for the case where we triple the size of the
array (both if we are only able to use whole tokens and if we're
allowed to have an amortized cost of a fraction of a token).

\begin{solution}
  If we triple the size of the array, we still need to reserve
  $\frac{3}{2}$ tokens for a total amortized cost of $\frac{5}{2}$
  tokens (3 if we disallow partial tokens) Starting from an array with
  size $\frac{k}{3}$ and length $k$, $\frac{2k}{3}$ insertions we fill
  up the array. At this point we have $\frac{3}{2} \times
  \frac{2k}{3}$ tokens reserved, and we need to copy $k$ elements over
  to the newly allocated array.
