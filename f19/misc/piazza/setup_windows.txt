TITLE: Laptop Setup for Windows

CONTENT (paste into plain-text editor on Piazza):
=================================================

If you have a Windows computer, follow these steps to set it up to connect to the Andrew system. If you need help, come to one of the setup sessions this week.
For Mac, see @[TBD].
For Linux, see @[TBD].

1) Download and install <a href="http://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/download-home-edition.html" target="_blank">MobaXterm Home Edition</a> (Installer edition), then restart your computer.

2) Open MobaXterm and click the "Session" button in the top left corner of the window.

3) Select "SSH" as the session type.

4) Enter "unix.andrew.cmu.edu" as the Remote host, click the checkbox for "Specify username", and enter your andrew id in the field.

5) Click "Ok" to connect via SSH, and enter your password when prompted. You may opt to save your password.

6) Check to make sure that X forwarding is working properly by running this command:
<pre>display ~rjsimmon/public/couch.jpg &amp;</pre>
After a few seconds (be patient!), you should see a window appear with a picture of a couch. If that works, you're all set up! In the future, double-click the "unix.andrew.cmu.edu" session in the Saved sessions menu whenever you want to connect.

If you're getting errors or having trouble, ask a TA at a setup session.
