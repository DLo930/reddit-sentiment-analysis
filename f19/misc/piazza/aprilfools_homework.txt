=================================================

HEY EVERYONE. Sorry for the abrupt notice, but we forgot to mention that there was a super short programming assignment due tomorrow since Generic Queues is due a week from Monday. oops!

But don't worry!! It's really short, I promise. It'll be due tomorrow night [April 1st ;) ;) ;)] at 9pm. It's short!!!! Do it quick, and you'll be okay.

Due to the abrupt nature of this assignment, no help will be given by TAs at office hours. Don't worry - the TAs playtested the assignment and no TA took more than 15 minutes in total.

Also, Autolab ran out of memory, so I'm going to post it here. The handout says how to submit, so everything should be pretty straightforward. No need to ask questions. It's 3 short and easy questions, inflated to be out of 2147483647 points as a boost for your grade.

Good luck and have fun! ;) ;)
