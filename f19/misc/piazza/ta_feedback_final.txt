=================================================

Hi Everyone,

The course staff has worked hard all semester to make this course the best it could possibly be. As the semester is coming to an end, <strong>we would really appreciate everyone's input</strong> on how we did, and how we could improve in the future. Many of our current TAs will be returning to TA the course next semester, and your honest feedback will enable us to make the course even better.

<strong>It's easy</strong>: just click the following link and write as much (or as little) as you like in the boxes for your lab TAs, recitation TAs, and any other TAs you interacted with this semester:

[LINK TBD]

Thanks for helping us make 15-122 the best it can possibly be!
-the 15-122 Staff
